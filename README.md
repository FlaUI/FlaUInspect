### New 2.0.0 
New has been [released](https://github.com/FlaUI/FlaUInspect/releases/tag/v2.0.0)!

This is a major update with a lot of changes:
* Complete rewrite of the application
* New UI
* New features
* Much more stable
* Based on .NET 8
* Three separate versions for UIA2 and UIA3 and default with choosing on startup


### Installation
To install FlaUInspect, either build it yourself or get the zip from the releases page here on GitHub (https://github.com/FlaUI/FlaUInspect/releases).

### Description
There are various tools around which help inspecting application that should be ui tested or automated. Some of them are:
* VisualUIAVerify
* Inspect
* UISpy
* and probably others
Most of them are old and sometimes not very stable and (if open source), a code mess to maintain.

FlaUInspect is supposed to be a modern alternative, based on [FlaUI](https://github.com/Roemer/FlaUI).

On startup of FlaUInspect, you can choose if you want to use UIA2 or UIA3 (see [FAQ](https://github.com/Roemer/FlaUI/wiki/FAQ) why you can't use both at the same time).
You can use pre-built versions of FlaUInspect.UIA2 and FlaUInspect.UIA3 if you want to use a version of UIA.
